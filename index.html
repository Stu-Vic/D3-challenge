            Some interesting insights:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The age demographic is squarely within the middle age range from age 30-45.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is a positive correlation between the Lacks Healthcare and In Poverty. Southern states tend to have the highest rates of poverty and less healthcare coverage (with Texas being an outlier as it has the highest % lacking healthcare) while some New England states have the lowest rates of poverty and lack of healthcare.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is a negative correlation between Lacks Healthcare and Household Income, so wealthier states tend to have more healthcare coverage.
              </li>
              <li>
                Smoking has a negative correlation with household income, no correlation with age, and a positive correlation with poverty.
              </li>
              <li>
                Obesity also has a positive correlation with poverty, none with age, and a negative correlation with household income.
